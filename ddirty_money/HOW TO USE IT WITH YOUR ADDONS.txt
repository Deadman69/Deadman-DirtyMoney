To use it with your addons you need really basics skills in gLua, you need to replace the function where an item is supposed to give money
with the following:


player:SetNWInt("Dirtymoney", amountToGive) -- Will define player Dirtymoney amount
player:SetNWInt("Dirtymoney", player:GetNWInt("Dirtymoney") + amountToGive) -- Will add player Dirtymoney amount





And to get it, you can use:


player:GetNWInt("Dirtymoney") -- Will return player Dirty Money amount
DirtyMoneyGetValue(player)  -- Will return player Dirty Money
